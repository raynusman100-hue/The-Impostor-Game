## 🔑 Important Notes

### About Signing:
- ✅ **EAS Build** creates a signed AAB automatically
- ✅ **Google Play** re-signs with Play App Signing (automatic)
- ❌ **You DON'T need** to provide production keystore manually
- ✅ **Internal testing** uses the same signing as production

### About Package Names:
- Package name is **LOCKED** after first upload
- Cannot be changed later
- Make sure it matches everywhere:
  - `app.json`: ✅ `com.rayn100.impostergame`
  - `build.gradle`: ✅ `com.rayn100.impostergame`
  - Google Play Console: ✅ `com.rayn100.impostergame`

### About RevenueCat:
- App ID: `appe839010e85` ✅
- iOS Key: `app06ec5f375b` ✅
- Android Key: `goog_xxxxxxxxxx` ⚠️ **UPDATE THIS**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Package name mismatch" error:
- Fixed! All package names now match.

### "Upload failed" error:
- Make sure you're uploading `.aab` not `.apk`
- Check file size (should be 30-80 MB)
- Try re-building with `eas build`

### "Signing error":
- EAS handles signing automatically
- No manual keystore needed for internal testing

### RevenueCat not working:
- Update Android API key in `PurchaseManager.js`
- Link Google Play service account in RevenueCat dashboard
- Test with real device (not emulator)
